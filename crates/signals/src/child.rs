//! Child processes with a bound: [`run`] spawns a command, feeds its stdin, drains its output while it runs, and
//! stops it past a timeout or on cancel. [`Watched`] is the child underneath: a thread of its own waits for the exit
//! (`waitid` with `WNOWAIT`, so the pid stays the child's until it is reaped under the lock), which lets other
//! threads wait for it with a deadline and signal it without ever reaching a reaped, reused pid.
